events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as clicking a button, loading a page, hovering over an element, or pressing a key on the keyboard. Events are essential for making web pages interactive, and JavaScript allows you to handle these events and define the behavior of the webpage in response.

Event Propagation ==>
Event propagation refers to the way events are propagated (bubbled or captured) through the DOM. Wecan control the propagation phase by providing a third argument (true for capturing, false for bubbling) in addEventListener.
    1. Event Bubbling: The event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the parent elements. This is the default behavior.
    2. Event Capturing: The event starts from the outermost element and propagates down to the target element.
