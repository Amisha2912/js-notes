# js & classes
Yes & No also.. actually No but Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) as a way to create objects and handle inheritance in a more structured and cleaner syntax compared to the traditional function-based approach.
A class in JavaScript is essentially a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. While JavaScript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance, they make object-oriented programming more intuitive and easier to work with.
Do focus on the term prototype-based . bcz JS is prototype-based language

# Objects 
-collection  of properties & methods
-eg toLowerCase(), promise bhi object hai bcz we use new Promise in Syntax

# Objects literal;
- An object literal is a simple and concise way to create objects using a syntax that consists of a comma-separated list of key-value pairs wrapped in curly braces ({}). Each key in an object literal is either a string (which may or may not be quoted) or a symbol, and each value can be any valid JavaScript expression, including functions, arrays, or other objects.
- eg
```javascript
const myObject = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    // ...
};
```


# some imp keywords
- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


# 4 pillars
- abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritence
- Polymorphism
